# 🧠 Advanced Agent Workflows with CrewAI

In the previous section, we explored:

* ✅ **Agent Capabilities**: Integrating agents with custom tools
* 🔁 **Flows**: Creating structured, event-driven workflows
* 🤝 **Multi-Crew Flows**: Coordinating multiple agents across different workflows

---

## 🚀 This Section Covers: Advanced Agent Concepts

We now delve deeper into powerful capabilities that elevate agent-based applications:

* 🛡️ **Guardrails**: Enforce output constraints and safety checks
* 🔗 **Referencing Task Outputs**: Dynamically use results from previous tasks
* ⚙️ **Asynchronous Execution**: Maximize throughput by running tasks in parallel
* 🔄 **Callbacks**: Post-task triggers for downstream actions
* 👨‍⚖️ **Human-in-the-Loop**: Add manual review and approval
* 🧱 **Hierarchical Agents**: Compose agents within agents
* 🖼️ **Multimodal Agents**: Handle text, images, audio, and more

## 🛡️ Guardrails: Constraining Agent Behavior

AI agents can be powerful but unpredictable. Guardrails ensure safety, reliability, and accuracy by enforcing rules on outputs.

### 🔒 Why Use Guardrails?

* **Prevent API overuse or irrelevant queries**
* **Ensure outputs meet validation criteria**
* **Fallback strategies on failure**

### 🏛️ Example (Legal Assistant):

Guardrails can:

* Prevent hallucinating legal facts
* Catch jurisdiction misinterpretations
* Block outdated precedent citations

## ✅ Example: Guardrail Function

Let’s say we want an agent that summarizes research papers **under 150 words**:

```python
def validate_summary_length(task_output):
    try:
        print("Validating summary length")
        task_str_output = str(task_output)
        total_words = len(task_str_output.split())

        print(f"Word count: {total_words}")

        if total_words > 150:
            return (False, f"Summary exceeds 150 words. Word count: {total_words}")

        if total_words == 0:
            return (False, "Generated summary is empty.")

        return (True, task_output)

    except Exception as e:
        return (False, f"Validation system error: {str(e)}")
```

### 🧪 Guardrail Return Format

```python
(True, validated_output)  # Success
(False, error_message)    # Validation failed
```

### 🧠 Task With Guardrail

```python
summary_task = Task(
    description="Summarize a research paper in 150 words.",
    expected_output="A concise research summary in 150 words.",
    agent=summary_agent,
    guardrail=validate_summary_length,
    max_retries=3
)
```

If validation fails, the task retries up to 3 times before failing.

## 🔗 Referencing Tasks & Outputs

Learn how to:

* Access results of previous tasks using `TaskOutput`
* Chain tasks where later steps depend on earlier outputs

📓 **Notebook**: `02_reference_tasks_outputs.ipynb`

---

## ⚙️ Asynchronous Task Execution

Run tasks **in parallel** to speed up workflows and reduce latency.

Use this when tasks are **independent** and don’t rely on each other’s outputs.

📓 **Notebook**: `03_async_execution.ipynb`

---

## 🔄 Callbacks: Post-Task Actions

Use callbacks to:

* Store results in a database
* Send alerts (e.g., Slack, email)
* Trigger follow-up tasks or scripts

### 💡 Example

```python
research_news_task = Task(
    description="Find and summarize the latest AI breakthroughs",
    expected_output="A structured summary of AI news headlines.",
    agent=research_agent,
    callback=notify_team
)
```
