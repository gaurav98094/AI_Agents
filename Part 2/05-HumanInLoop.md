# Human In Loop


Below, letâ€™s build a human-in-the-loop AI research system, where:

- An AI Researcher gathers and summarizes key industry insights.\
- A human reviewer checks and validates the AI-generated research.
- An AI Content Strategist writes a blog post based on the reviewed research.
- A human reviewer ensures the content is well-structured before publishing.
