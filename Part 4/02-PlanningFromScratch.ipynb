       "'Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that possess qualities akin to agency, meaning they have the capacity to act independently, make decisions, and pursue goals based on their programming and learning. These systems can interpret their environment, perform tasks without constant human oversight, and adapt to new situations to achieve their objectives.\\n\\nAgentic AI often involves decision-making processes, autonomy, goal-directed behavior, and sometimes learning mechanisms that enable the system to improve its performance over time. It can be contrasted with reactive AI, which operates based on pre-defined rules and responses without the capacity for independent decision-making or goal-setting.\\n\\nExamples of Agentic AI might include autonomous vehicles, advanced robotics systems, and AI-driven virtual assistants that can manage complex workflows without direct human intervention. The development of Agentic AI is a significant area of research, with implications for ethics, safety, and the role of AI in society.'"
