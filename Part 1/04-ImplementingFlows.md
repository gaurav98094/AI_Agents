## Implementing Flows


<b>Aim : </b> Generate a random movie genre and suggest a popular movie.


```python
# !pip install crewai
# !pip install crewai-tools
```


```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, start, listen

import openai
import os

openai_client = openai.OpenAI(api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
```


```python
class MovieRecommendationFlow(Flow):
    
    @start()
    def generate_genre(self):
        response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
            model = "gpt-4o-mini",
            messages = [
                {
                    "role" : "user",
                    "content" : "Give me a random movie genre."
                }
            ]
        )

        random_genre = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
        self.state['genre'] = random_genre
        return random_genre
    

    @listen(generate_genre)
    def recomment_movie(self, random_genre):
        response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
            model = "gpt-4o-mini",
            messages = [
                {
                    "role" : "user",
                    "content" : f"Recommend a movie in the genre of {random_genre}."
                }
            ]
        )

        movie_recommendation = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
        self.state['recommendation'] = movie_recommendation
        return movie_recommendation
```


```python
flow = MovieRecommendationFlow()

final_result = await flow.kickoff_async()

print(final_result)
